* <a href="https://github.com/DanielBradford/bamboo-fitness/blob/master/documents/wireframes/MOBILE%20WIREFRAMES%20(All%20pages).pdf" target="_blank">Mobile Wireframes</a>

## **Design**
* Although the mobile first method is recommended and heavily supported by bootstrap, i went via the desktop first approach to fully realise the initial design idea. 
* The idea behind this is assuming more users would be accessing the website from a Desktop therefore it seemed to be the correct approach for this project in particular. 
* In future, the mobile first method may be more suitable due to societies increase in mobile web activity.
## **Style / Theme**
* As the gym is called Bamboo Fitness and has a strong connection to the environment and ecology, i decided to use the following themes:
    * Natural Colour Scheme: green(#008300), brown(#4a3700) an gold(#a87b00)
    * I also used a strong purple (#48008a) to stand out from the overall theme. This was used sparingly on button features and selected text.

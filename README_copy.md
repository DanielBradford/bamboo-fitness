This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes,
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself

## Features
### The project is comprised of a number of features.
These include:
* **Call To Action Button on landing page** - This invites the user to JOIN the gym. The selection of this button opens a data capture form (via a Modal). This opens a channel of contact between the user and the gym.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Features Left to Implement
Another feature idea
Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.

## Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

## Performance and Accessibility
### From using the technologies of Wave and Lighthouse i was able to check the performance and accessiblity of the website. 
### By generating reports and using the feedback i was able to make alterations in both the HTML and CSS code to improve the accessiblity of the site.
### An example of this would be the change in color schemes to maximise the contrast score allowing text and layout to be visible to a wider group of users with accessiblity issues.
### An example of enhanced performance was changing the .jpg & .png files into webP to minimalise memory usage and speed up loading and rendering times.

## **Deployment** ##
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
